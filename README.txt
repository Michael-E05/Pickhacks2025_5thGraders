Hello! Thank you for testing our silly code!


Instructions for installation:
0. For this example, we used the Windows version of VSCode.

1. Install listed libraries with the following commands:
  pip install google-genai

  pip install flask

  pip install google

2. Generate an API Key via Google Gemini (This is free!!!)

3. Inside HOLGame.py, at line 7 insert your own API key

4. Run "HOLGame.py" and click on the URL that flask provides you. (For example 127.0.0.1:5000)

Enjoy our project! We hope you have as much fun playing as we did programming! #PickHacks2025

Troubleshoot:

If you get an "Internal Server Error" stop the program and re-run it, should fix it, if not refresh the page.
If you press an option and nothing happens, click again (I promise).
