Hello! Thank you for testing our silly code!

Prerequisites:
Python (Recommended version: 3.13)

Instructions for installation:
0. For this example, we used the Windows version of VSCode.

0.5. This git repository must be installed as a whole for the program to run. Click on the green "Code" button from the respository's website and then select "Download as ZIP". 
     Once the folder is downloaded, find it in your file explorer and then right click and select "Extract All"
     Once the prior steps are done, run HOLGame.py

1. Install listed libraries with the following commands:
  pip install google

  pip install flask

  pip install google-genai

2. Generate an API Key via Google Gemini (This is free!!!)

3. Inside HOLGame.py, at line 7 insert your own API key

4. Run "HOLGame.py" and click on the URL that flask provides you. (For example 127.0.0.1:5000)

Enjoy our project! We hope you have as much fun playing as we did programming! #PickHacks2025

Troubleshoot:

If you get an "Internal Server Error" stop the program and re-run it, should fix it, if not refresh the page.
If you press an option and nothing happens, click again (I promise).
