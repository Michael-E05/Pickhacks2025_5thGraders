Hello! Thank you for testing our silly code!

Instructions for installation:

1. Once installed inside this directory, make 2 new folders named "static" and "templates"

2. Place "styles.css" into the "static" folder and place the "index.html" into "templates"

3. Run "Pythontest1.py" and click on the URL that flask provides you. (For example 127.0.0.1:5000)

4. Enjoy our project! We hope you have as much fun playing as we did programming! #PickHacks2025
